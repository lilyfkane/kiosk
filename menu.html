    <p>This semester, I’ve taken on photography and videography via my Canon EOS R100 camera, which I purchased in August. I went into this class with no prior knowledge about cameras or how to use them. Over the last few months, thanks to the various projects I’ve curated for this course, I’ve slowly acquired different skills within the discipline. </h2> 
    <p>For my final project, I have chosen to focus on videography and filmmaking and what makes this so magical. While I don’t have the fanciest camera out there, that’s okay because I really wanted to explore the simple things I encounter daily—real, raw, and authentic. I focused on human relationships, the landscape, and life’s unnoticed details. While capturing this footage, I searched for beauty in the mundane, or in other words, things we only notice when we stop and smell the roses. </p>
    <p>In the fashion of the famous Truman Show quote, I have created three videos called Good Afternoon, Good Evening, and Goodnight. Navigate the “Menu” tab on the left to learn more about my creations.
